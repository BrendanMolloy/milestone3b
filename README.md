Second attempt at Data Centric Development Project

In this project I hope to create a simple website called suburban dictionary 
This website will allow visitors to upload their own puns or (maybe-not-so-) clever wordplay.
As is often the case with this kind of dad-jokery, these puns can be cringe-inducing;
and so users will also be able to makes changes or even simply delete uploads 
that they feel are of an insufficient embarrassment quotient.

In this way I hope to demonstrate my ability to CRUD using a database of user-generated puns.
